# Claims Classification

This repository contains the portfoilo project for the Google Advanced Data Analytics Professional Certificate program. It consists of 7 courses with over 200 hours of instruction and hundreds of practice-based assessments. To learn more about the certificate on Coursera, click [here](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-advanced-data-analytics).

**Note:** In the certificate, I chose to complete the project using the TikTok workplace scenario which was created in partnership with TikTok. The story, all names, characters, and incidents portrayed in this project are **fictitious**. No identification with actual persons (living or deceased) is intended or should be inferred. And, the data shared in this project has been created for pedagogical purposes.

## :memo: Project Description

**Goal:** The TikTok data team is developing a machine learning model for classifying claims made in videos submitted to the platform.

**Background**: TikTok is the leading destination for short-form mobile video. The platform is built to help imaginations thrive. TikTok's mission is to create a place for inclusive, joyful, and authentic content–where people can safely discover, create, and connect.

**Scenario:** As a data analyst on TikTok's data team, you'll help by preparing the data needed for the claims classification project. You’ll build a dataframe, organize the claims data for the process of exploratory data analysis, and update the team on your progress and insights.
