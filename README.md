# Claims Classification

This repository contains the portfoilo project for the Google Advanced Data Analytics Professional Certificate program. It consists of 7 courses with over 200 hours of instruction and hundreds of practice-based assessments. To learn more about the certificate on Coursera, click [here](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-advanced-data-analytics).

**Note:** In the certificate, I chose to complete the project using the TikTok workplace scenario which was created in partnership with TikTok. The story, all names, characters, and incidents portrayed in this project are **fictitious**. No identification with actual persons (living or deceased) is intended or should be inferred. And, the data shared in this project has been created for pedagogical purposes.

## :memo: Project Description

**Goal:** The TikTok data team is developing a machine learning model for classifying claims made in videos submitted to the platform.

**Background**: At TikTok, our mission is to inspire creativity and bring joy. Our employees lead with curiosity and move at the speed of culture. Combined with our company's flat structure, you'll be given dynamic opportunities to make a real impact on a rapidly expanding company and grow your career.

TikTok users have the ability to report videos and comments that contain user claims. These reports identify content that needs to be reviewed by moderators. This process generates a large number of user reports that are difficult to address quickly. 

TikTok is working on the development of a predictive model that can determine whether a video contains a claim or offers an opinion. With a successful prediction model, TikTok can reduce the backlog of user reports and prioritize them more efficiently.

## :open_book: Summary

This project consists of 7 parts:

1. Project Proposal: Organize project tasks into milestones, classify tasks using the PACE (Plan, Analyze, Construct, Execute) workflow, and identify relevant stakeholders.
    - Deliverables: Project proposal
2. Preliminary Data Investigation: Inspect, organize, and prepare the data for analysis. Summarize findings in executive summary
    - Deliverables: Preliminary data investigation in Jupyter Notebook, executive summary
3. Exploratory Data Analysis: Explore, analyze, and visualize data. Use Tableau to create visuals and executive summary to help non-technical stakeholders engage and interact with the data.
    - Deliverables: EDA in Jupyter Notebook, visualizations in Tableau, executive summary
4. Hypothesis Testing: Conduct hypothesis testing to analyze the relationship between video_view_count and verified_status.
    - Deliverables: Hypothesis testing in Jupyter Notebook, executive summary
